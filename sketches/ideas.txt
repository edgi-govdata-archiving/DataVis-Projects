Instead of seperating by protocol (HTTPS, HTTP, FTP), seperate by Website/Agency (most are seperated into EPA, Research Institutions, Other)

Information Needed to be displayed in initial model:

Protocol
Agency/Company
Specific Category (climate, chemical, children, etc..)
Completion Rate


The methods I suggest:

Bilevel Partition: https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/5944371
Sequence Outburst: https://bl.ocks.org/kerryrodden/7090426
Donut Chart: http://www.datavizcatalogue.com/methods/donut_chart.html
Heat Map: http://bl.ocks.org/tjdecke/5558084


Any other data can be displayed in another model that the user might navigate to in the initial model loaded seperately.
